# Overview

truncate_with_hover is a simple gem that adds the method
`truncate_with_hover` to `ActionView::Helpers::TextHelper`.
This method behaves like `truncate`, except that it wraps everything in
a `<span>` tag with the non-truncated text as the `title` attribute.

## TODO

Write some specs :)
